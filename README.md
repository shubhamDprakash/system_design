# system_design
This is a repository for practicing both Low Level and High Level system design.

Low Level Design: - 
1. First list out all the use cases and actors and create a use case diagram.
2. Write class of the base system first then keep writing complex classes to decouple the base system.
3. Look for which actor are present in the system and then start defining the actors in the best way possible.
4. Then start defining all the use cases pertaining to those actors based upon relationships between different actors and design the entire system.
